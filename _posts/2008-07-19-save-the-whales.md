What’s the right balance of fun and challenge to keep people playing a game? That's one of the questions I was thinking about when making Save The Whales, a game where you slingshot a little man into the air to pop balloons and send whales back into the ocean. You have to aim the guy, shoot with the right amount of power, and pop at just the right time!

Note that I programmed this game in actionscript, so it requires Flash and won’t work on iOS, but [check it out](http://www.adamkiryk.com/whales/) if you have flash.
