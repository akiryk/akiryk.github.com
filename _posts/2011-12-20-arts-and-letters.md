[Arts & Letters Daily](http://www.aldaily.com/) is a great website. I first heard of it years ago — I believe in 1997 — when I attended an [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) lecture and he recommended it, and since then I've visited it regularly for its great links to interesting content. The thing is, the design's remained the same since then, and it's getting a little past it's prime.

Here's a screen grab on the left. The page is dense, with too many small-print options for comfortable reading and a terrible user experience on smartphones. The content is organized into categories called *Articles of Note*, *New Books*, and *Essays and Opinion,* which may seem reasonable at first glance, but aren't really meaningful because each is so fluid that it could easily contain almost any link on the site.

My biggest criticism, though, is that it's hard to find stuff that interests me. What would make it easier? Perhaps just a few simple things: a cleaner, less cluttered design; more meaningful categories; a way to know the source (e.g. *New York Times* or *Chronicle of Higher Education*), and a clear publication date so I know what's fresh.

To show my love for the site, I designed what I believe would be [a big improvement](http://www.aldaily.adamkiryk.com/) and shared it with the editors. They haven't implemented it, but, hey — you can't win them all. 

In any case, here's what I did. I created a wordpress theme that's easy to maintain, and a cleaned-up design in which each link is given the space it deserves. It still emphasizes the editors' quirky comments on all manner of content, but displays category, date, and source right alongside. 

{% assign photo="single" %}
{% assign caption="On hover, the comment changes color and displays an arrow icon, indicating it's a link. Category, date, and source, are presented clearly." %}
{% include custom/pic_normal %}

My focus was very much on highlighting to content so that users could find engaging content. With a cleaner, more open, more readable look, I think I've done that. And it looks good. I even included all the sidebar links — even though they're somewhat confusing, I think they help make Arts and Letters Daily unique. 

{% assign photo="desktop" %}
{% assign caption="My redesign for Arts & Letters Daily." %}
{% include custom/pic_normal %}

Finally, I made it responsive — a very basic version, to be sure, but miles better than the existing site.
