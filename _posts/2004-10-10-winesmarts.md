<p class="intro">I was lead illustrator and designer on this project way back in 2002. It involved creating branding for a new company and designing the packaging for it's first product, a trivia-style card game for wine lovers.</p>

    For this project to succeed, I needed to create a visual language that could work for both the Smarts Company brand and the WineSmarts product — neither of which existed at the time. Further, the design had to have enough flexibility that it could be extended to a line of future products: trivia games about subjects like chocolate, food, and golf that the company's founders intended to create before long.

To begin, I designed a logo — the Smarts Company logo — that expressed a combination of playfulness, education, and fun. (That was my goal, anyway. Logo design isn't my strength or my passion, but in this case, I think I succeeded in subtly referencing things like a cheer-leader's bullhorn, or a cartoon's shouted speech bubble, or a team flag, or even — very subtly — the swoosh of a checkmark, any or all of which supported the brand's message of fun, learning, good cheer). Oh, and it would also lock-up well with other titles such as Chocolate Smarts or Food Smarts or Sex Smarts.

Once we settled on a logo, I started work on the packaging. Why not begin with the cards, since they were the foundation of the enterprise? Business reasons. The clients needed to sell the idea to retailers before they actually had the finished product in-hand, and for that they needed a compelling package design.

I created illustrations and a visual language that was modular, in the sense that the pieces could be fit together in different ways to suit different product categories. Per the creative brief, the design was intended to look informal, contemporary, and inviting, playful without being a kid's toy and modern without being cold. 

Was it successful? To a large degree. The product wasn't a blockbuster, but the founders were written up in various business magazines because of it; they got it carried by desirable retailers (like the Museum of Modern Art gift store); and it stuck around for several years and several editions. And, hey, I was happy with the results. I think WineSmarts is still available — search for it on Amazon or Google.
