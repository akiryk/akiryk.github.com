<p class="intro">I was lead illustrator and designer on this project, which involved creating branding for a new company and designing the packaging for it's first product, a trivia-style card game for wine lovers.</p>

<div class="marginator">
  <p>
    This was a complicated project, because it involved creating the visual language for both a brand and a product, neither of which existed at the time. The brand, SmartsCo., was a startup game company whose founders hoped it would profit by creating fun and attractive trivia games about subjects like wine, chocolate, food, and sex.

    <p><span class="margin-heading">Success!</span> It looks like my original clients went on to sell the product, and somebody has been <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/?pn=SmartsCo">going crazy making spinoffs</a> of my original design 
    </p></div>

To begin, they only had a small budget and a set of a few hundred (hopefully entertaining) questions about wine, vetted and approved by wine experts. Where to start? Designing the trivia cards would have probably made a lot of sense, since that was the meat of the whole thing. But we didn't start with the cards because the business needed to find shop owners who would be willing to stock the product — and on first glance, the product *was* the package. So we started by designing the package. 

It quickly became apparent that the packaging needed to communicate the SmartsCo identity almost as much as the nature of its contents because our clients wanted to grow the brand quickly into other areas of educational trivia. We needed the packaging to say clearly, "I'm a wine trivia game" but also "I'm part of a family of related products." 

<div class="content-outset">
  <h2>Like, the SexSmarts® box needs to say <em>I'm about sex!</em> and — at the same time — I'm related to DogSmarts®</h2>
</div>

Anyway, all this simply means that the project went in several directions at once. What should the logo communicate? What mood should the package convey? What would be the right balance of playful versus educational? What set of visual elements would have the flexibility to support a wide range of possible subjects (like sex, golf, or music) and still feel related?

I developed a simple logo that expressed a playful energy and a style of illustration that lent itself to different configurations. For wine, I used a bottle, grapes, and a glass — for future products, we could easily change the palette and replace the imagery.
