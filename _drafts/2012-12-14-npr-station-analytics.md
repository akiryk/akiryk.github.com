<p class="intro">
  In 2012, we launched an experiment to see how we could leverage NPR’s Facebook presence by posting member-station stories that we’d geo-target to the member-station’s region. It’s been a <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/02/how-npr-drove-traffic-to-a-local-station-by-geotargeting-stories-on-facebook/?hq_e=el&hq_m=2040998&hq_l=1&hq_v=437cc910b2">big success</a> For example, KPLU in Seattle would post a story to NPR’s Facebook page that would only be seen by NPR fans who lived around Seattle. Done well, this had the potential to benefit both NPR and the individual member stations. The experiment did very well.

  Here's something important I'd like to say. Really like to say, really.
</p>

During the first four months of the experiment, we posted about 50 geofocused KPLU links — a fraction of all KPLU content — on NPR’s Facebook page. These posts accounted for 12 percent of KPLU.org’s sitewide visits during this four-month period. The test helped KPLU achieve three milestones: record traffic for a single day (January 19), second-highest traffic for a single month (October 2011) and the highest traffic for a single month (January).

To build on that success, we decided to assemble a small team including me (design and front-end developer), a backend developer, and an editor to build a tool that would make it easier for stations to pitch stories to NPR. Working over a few weeks, we build a tool that is focused and easy to use. You paste the url to a story you want to pitch, make any edits inline, and then engage in a community-wide vetting process to select the best posts.

The thirty or so stations that use it spend a lot of time looking at the different posts, responding to comments and trying to get their own stories accepted. We just enabled a notifications system (visible in the videos) because we learned that journalists were keeping the window open all day long and wanted an easier way to learn when others had commented on their posts.

The first video shows what NPR editors see — it’s mostly the same as station journalists, but they can choose whether to accept or reject a given pitch. The site is responsive since so many of the users are working off of tablets and phones. The second video shows what stations see.
