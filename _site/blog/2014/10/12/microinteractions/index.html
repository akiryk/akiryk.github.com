      <div class="content-body">
        <p style="font-style: italic;"><a href="/tag/bus-ride-reads/">Bus ride reads</a> is an occasional series in which I discuss a design or ux book I&rsquo;ve been reading on my commute. More recap than review, my goal is to capture the key ideas that stand out for me, and to explore how those ideas relate to my own work whenever possible. </p>

<p>Microinteractions, by Dan Saffer, is about little details that make a huge difference. If you’ve ever looked through the tumblr <a href="http://littlebigdetails.com/">Little Big Details</a>, you have a decent idea of the kind of thing it covers — and the book is full of examples from that site. But whereas Little Big Details typically celebrates unexpected moments of delight or humor, Microinteractions stresses the role small things play in the overall success of a technology. </p>

<p>First, as the name implies, a microinteraction is a little bitty thing, usually — but not always — part of a larger feature. From the book: &ldquo;A music player is a feature; adjusting the volume is a microinteraction.” Because such interactions are small and highly focused, they can and should be at the pinnacle of simplicity and ease-of-use. The book’s thesis is that well-polished micro interactions not only help make products great, but can become “signature” moments in their own right — key elements in making something truly stand out. </p>

<p>There are four parts of a micro interaction. The trigger, rules, feedback, and loops and modes. </p>

<p>The trigger is fairly self-explanatory. It could be a button that says “log in” or it could be a camera icon that opens a smartphone camera. Triggers can be super obvious, like the public transit kiosks with a giant “touch me” call-to-action, or they can be hidden, like with Google Maps for iOS, where shaking the phone is a invisible trigger for giving feedback. As a designer, you have to strike a balance where the interface is clean and simple and scannable enough that users can easily do the main tasks they want to do, yet not so minimal that the key functionality is  lost. How to determine when to be self-evident and when to be subtle is obviously a trick. Saffer quotes what he calls a golden rule:</p>

<blockquote>Microinteractions that most people do, most often, should be highly discoverable.<br/><br/>
Microinteractions that some people do, somewhat often, should be easily discoverable.<br/><br/>
Microinteractions that few people do, infrequently, should take some searching to find.</blockquote>

<div class="caption">When a user touches the scrubber, all other controls are hidden so that the user can focus exclusively on the task.</div>
</div>

<p>This seems hard to argue with, although sometimes designers have to guess about what things people will do most often, or even about what counts as highly discoverable. I love the way we’ve handled the scrubber on our NPR One app, because the trigger <em>is</em> the scrubber. You touch it to scrub and it becomes larger for easy handling. It’s the best of both worlds, because the interface is uncluttered yet still highly findable — the animated image at right shows how it changes on touch. </p>

<p>The book describes several principles of good trigger design. I won’t list them all, but a couple seem worth noting.</p>

<p>First, it should initiate the same action every time. Apparently, the Galaxy S Note has icons that display different menus  depending on when you click on them, which is confusing and counterproductive because it prevents users from developing an accurate mental model of how the micro interaction works.</p>

<p>Not to harp on iPhoto too much, but they suffer from this problem as well. Clicking on the “Share” item in the upper-left set of options displays a sub-menu with Facebook, Flickr, and the like. </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="iPhoto has two share triggers, but they don't do the same thing.">
  <span data-src="/assets/images/9-14-microinteractions/share1-small.jpg"></span>
  <span data-src="/assets/images/9-14-microinteractions/share1-med.jpg" data-media="(min-width: 26.25em)"></span>

  </span>
<div class="caption">iPhoto has two share triggers, but they don&rsquo;t do the same thing.</div>
</div>

<p>Clicking on the “Share” item in the lower right set of options displays a sub-menu with the same options but also others, including buttons to create a book, order prints, or make an album. If a user has learned that “share” means share on social media, how likely is it they’ll click the share button when trying to create a book? </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="Unlike 'share' above, this one enables user to make books, cards, and other assets.">
  <span data-src="/assets/images/9-14-microinteractions/share2-small.jpg"></span>

  </span>
<div class="caption">Unlike &lsquo;share&rsquo; above, this one enables user to make books, cards, and other assets.</div>
</div>

<p>Second, the trigger should bring the data forward. This is a cool idea and worth aiming to do when it makes sense, as in a notifications badge that is first a trigger to view messages and second an indicator of how many messages you have. This can also work really well with button labels. For example, if someone is on a donation form and has selected to give $200, have the button say &quot;Donate $200&rdquo; instead of the more common and less explicit &ldquo;Donate&rdquo; or &ldquo;Submit.&rdquo; </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="The button text changes as a user toggles between monthly and one-time payments.">

</div>

<p>As a counter-example, Dropbox does not bring data forward in its trigger for viewing a folder — you just see a plain folder icon. This means you have to click into the folder to find out if it&rsquo;s empty or not, which can be kind of frustrating. In the image below, I’ve contrasted the default display with a simple variation that brings some data forward: <em>Bully From Space</em> is empty; <em>Photos</em> has 22 files.</p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="In this animated gif, notice how we can improve Dropbox's design by bringing data forward. Adding nothing more than a number to the folder icon enables us to see that one folder is empty and the other has content. ">

</div>

<p><strong>Rules</strong>
Every micro interaction has to have rules. Some are very simple: only show the login button if a user isn’t already logged in. Some are more complex: only show the option to translate a web page if it&rsquo;s in a language other than the user’s default. Saffer’s general advice is to limit options so that the rules stay simple. The whole idea of a micro interaction is to do one small thing really well, so you want to be careful of trying to do to much. </p>

<p>In my Gronster drawing game, I built some shortcuts for changing the color and size of the brush, but I didn’t want to over-complicate the experience by making everyone read through a paragraph of help text. Instead, I created a rule that says: if a user changes the size of their brush more than two times, show them a little help tip explaining the shortcut. </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="Not all users will want to be bothered by remembering  keyboard shortcuts, so Gronster doesn't display them. On the other hand, users who change colors regularly are more likely to benefit. There's a rule for that.">

</div>

<p><strong>An ounce of prevention&hellip;</strong>
In interactions that user-input, there’s the possibility of errors. Certainly, one can always fall back on the old error message — in many cases, they’re unavoidable. But it’s better to eliminate the chance of errors if at all possible. For example, when pasting a url into a field in this internal NPR app, we don’t give an error if the user forgets to add the ‘http://&rsquo; part, we do it for them. </p>

<p><strong>Absorb complexity</strong> Basically, if the computer can help out users by making a calculation or identifying a reasonable default, do it. </p>

<p><strong>Controls and User Input</strong></p>

<p>I found Saffer’s discussion of operational simplicity vs. perceived simplicity to be a bit confusing, but I think I can explain what he means. In this image of two blenders, the old one with all the buttons would be considered operationally simple because it gives every command its own control, such as stir, whip, or beat. The Vitamix, on the other hand, has perceived simplicity because a single control — the middle dial — enables several actions.</p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="A vintage blender with operational simplicity and a Vitamix with perceived simplicity.">

  </span>
<div class="caption">A vintage blender with operational simplicity and a Vitamix with perceived simplicity.</div>
</div> 

<p>How to decide when to go for operational simplicity or perceived simplicity? Saffer says:</p>

<p>For micro interactions that will be done repeatedly, err on the side of perceived simplicity, unless it is an action that needs to be done quickly and with no chance of error — for example, the Mute button on a conference phone; combing it with the Make Quieter action would probably be a disaster. For micro interactions that will only be done once or occasionally, err on the side of operational simplicity; display all the options so that little to no foreknowledge is required.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong> We need to provide feedback to our users that their action has had an effect. Sometimes this is embedded in the micro-interaction and no additional feedback is necessary — for example, if I click “pause” on Spotify, the music stops. I don’t need it to tell me, “Hey, we’ve stopped the music.” On the other hand, many interactions aren’t so clearcut. If I click on an Add to Cart button on a shopping experience, I’ll need some kind of feedback that my action was successful. </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="Saffer cautions against using animations to communicate feedback unless the information is critical. Debatable in this case, but it's not a bad implementation.">
  <span data-src="/assets/images/9-14-microinteractions/shopping-cart-small.gif"></span>

  </span>
<div class="caption">Saffer cautions against using animations to communicate feedback unless the information is critical. Debatable in this case, but it&rsquo;s not a bad implementation.</div>
</div>

<p>Two ideas stand out to me from this section:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>With feedback, less is often more. Giving users too much information at the wrong time can be confusing, so aim to provide the least amount of feedback necessary to communicate what’s going on. Simply showing a little cart icon with a number 1 in it might be all you need to do to indicate success rather than an actual animation.</p></li>
<li><p>“Use the overlooked as a means of message delivery.” I’d love to see more of this, and there are probably a variety of ways to do this in projects I’m currently working on. Could the play button in an online audio player indicate something about the duration of the audio clip? Could a spinning/loading icon reveal information about the file being loaded?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The last section of the book is about loops and modes. Loops are all the micro interactions that occur in some kind of repeating way — an alarm, say. Modes are different states of an interface — like normal vs edit. Saffer cautions that modes can cause confusion, because the same or similar triggers can behave in new ways. For example, in the Stitcher podcast app, the normal behavior for clicking on a podcast is to display options related to that podcast — save for later, view all, etc. But in the edit mode, clicking on a podcast does nothing. I think Stitcher does a reasonably good job with this, because they make it really clear when you’re in edit mode, but it’s worthwhile thinking hard about how best to handle modes. </p>

<div class="pic-normal">
  <span data-picture data-alt="Two screens for different modes on Stitcher, a podcast listening app — normal on left and edit on right.">

</div>

<p>The book covers a lot more than what I’ve mentioned here, but these are the things that stood out most to me. It’s important to design triggers carefully, to use them consistently, and to make give them the right degree of discoverability. Every micro interaction has rules, and they can quickly become difficult to manage, so it’s important to keep them simple whenever possible. Think creatively about how to give feedback, using overlooked design elements or moments of down-time to convey the right amount of information.   </p>
