      <div class="content-body">
        <p>In designing this site, I wanted to focus on creating a good reading experience, so I spent a bunch of time considering how best to handle body copy. I have a Typekit subscription, Google Fonts are free, and Typecast makes it super easy to try different options. So why would I stick with Georgia?</p>

<div class="pullquote pull-left">
  
<div class="gamma">Georgia. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to read. It doesn&rsquo;t draw attention to itself. And it&rsquo;s already on your computer. </div>

</div>

<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s interesting to note that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11573666">studies show people learn and remember better</a> when material is presented in a difficult-to-read manner. If text is set in a hand-writing font or if it&rsquo;s small or very faint, readers experience &ldquo;disfluency&rdquo; (cool word). It seems that when readers experience disfluency, they lose a bit of confidence — and lack of confidence causes people to slow down and pay closer attention. Paying closer attention results in better recall.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s cool, but it doesn&rsquo;t apply here. Obviously — since you&rsquo;re here voluntarily, and probably won’t read for very long under the best of circumstances. (I’m just saying, based on what analytics usually shows about bounce-rate and so on). So I’d like to do the opposite of encouraging disfluency, and I think I’ll do it by making text clean, clear, and readable. Georgia does these things well.</p>

<p>Georgia does some other things well, too. Like live on your computer. Web site performance isn’t typically thought of as a readability issue, per se, but the two things are closely linked. If you have to wait a couple of extra seconds to load a page, readability is compromised — because there’s nothing to read. One easy way to make pages load faster is for them to load less stuff, and unfortunately, web fonts count as <em>more</em> stuff. So with that in mind, I’m being cautious about loading anything that isn’t absolutely essential. Of course, I <em>will</em> load things that aren’t absolutely essential — I’ll just do it judiciously.</p>

<p>But Georgia’s so … commonplace. Can it be beautiful? </p>

<p>Yes, it can. For one thing, choosing an appropriate font is only part of good typography. It’s how one uses the font that enables content to really shine. For body copy on the web, this means finding the best balance of line length, leading, and font-size — and adjusting those things as necessary for different screen sizes.  It’s true that a badly designed font is going to look bad even when set really nicely. But a merely competent font could be made to look pretty good. And Georgia isn’t merely competent. </p>

<p>You probably already know this, but Georgia was designed by Matthew Carter (<a href="http://designmuseum.org/design/matthew-carter">not just any old type designer</a>) for the specific purpose of looking good on screen. He based it on a family of fonts that had been created in the early 19th century but modified the original structure in order to make his font nice for low-resolution devices. He simplified certain details that would get lost or muddied; he increased the x-height; he lightened the uppercase letters. In short, he worked hard to make a great font for pixel displays, and that partly explains why it’s become so ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Hmmm, ubiquitous doesn’t sound so cool. Things that are ubiquitous are easy to ignore; they have less punch; they have less meaning. True, but I’m also swayed by the notion of the crystal goblet. The idea, from the classic typography essay, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Goblet">Printing Should Be Invisible</a>, is that a well-crafted wineglass reveals its contents plainly, without drawing attention to itself. Well-crafted body text should do the same. In this sense, I think Georgia’s ubiquity could be an asset — you don’t pay it much attention; you just get down to reading. </p>

<p>So why would I ever use a web font? </p>

<p>One obvious reason is if I needed access to certain characters — something like small-caps or a particular weight or characters from another language. But that&rsquo;s a special case that doesn&rsquo;t apply to me right now.</p>

<div class="marginator">
  <p>
    Aside from that, I&rsquo;d use a web font in order to communicate a mood or feeling or character. For example, if I wanted to communicate a sense of literary seriousness, I&rsquo;d explore using something like Hoeffler. If I wanted to communicate a more solid, corporate tone, I might work with Neue Haas Grotesque. In my case, I&rsquo;d like the text to feel friendly, unpretentious, straightforward, approachable — all perfectly compatible with Georgia.
  </p>
  <div class="marginalia">
    <p><span class="margin-heading">Authoritative Fonts</span> Baskerville has a small but statistically significant edge over other fonts in terms of trust-worthiness, according to this <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/">clever study at the nytimes</a>.
    </p></div>
</div>

<p>So there you have it. Georgia has a friendly character, displays well on screen, comes fast and for free, and suits my purposes well. I&rsquo;ll take it. </p>

<p>As an addendum, here are screenshots from <a href="http://www.typecast.com">typecast</a> of a few of the fonts I considered using instead of Georgia. </p>

<h3>Chaparral</h3>

<p>Chaparral feels distinct, but not overly so. It has a friendly, approachable feel, and looks like something I’d be happy to read when set at something like 22/34, as in the image below. </p>

</div>

<h3>Tisa 20, 32</h3>

<p>Tisa also has a distinct look, which I like a lot. Medium uses it, and has written a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2013/07/05/why-did-medium-choose-ff-tisa-web-pro-as-the-font-for-posts/">good piece</a> of why they chose it.</p>

<h3>Merriweather</h3>

<p>This is a free font from Google that I like because it feels just a bit elegant and serious, but perfectly accessible and easy-to-read.</p>
