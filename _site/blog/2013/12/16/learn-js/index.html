        <p>Ed note: this is an edited version of <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">How To Learn Javascript Properly</a>. I didn&rsquo;t write it and claim no credit, but I think it&rsquo;s a great resource. I&rsquo;ve recreated it here with a couple of minor changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Instead of listing several alteratives for each reading assignment, I&rsquo;ve just given one. </p></li>
<li><p>Instead of packing lots of stuff into two-week segments, I&rsquo;ve packed less stuff into one-week segments. </p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve removed most of the words of encouragement. Sorry. You&rsquo;ll do fine!</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Before You Start</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Buy <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026691/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118026691&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=interhaptic-20">Professional Javascript for Web Developers</a></em></p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for an account on StackOverflow, a forum for asking programming questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for an account on Codecademy, a free tool for learning programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for an account on JSFiddle and/or CodePen, free tools for hacking around with front-end development.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&rsquo;t already know your way around Chrome&rsquo;s dev tools (you may not know them as well as you think), check out <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/">this set of tutorials</a> from codeschool.</p></li>
<li><p>Visit the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1ceefw/learn_javascript_properly_omnibus_post/">Learn JS Reddit</a>; it&rsquo;s a useful complement to the class with suggestions and problems to work on. </p></li>
<li><p>If you do not already know HTML and CSS very well, complete the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Web Fundamentals Track</a> on Codecademy.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, read through the <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">original guide here</a>. Only use this if you decide you like my simplified sequence. Also, the original has good advice about how to use Codecademy (hint: don&rsquo;t use it as a crutch) and how to learn (hint: lots of playing around in your browser&rsquo;s console window).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My own suggestion:</strong> Find a good way to memorize at least the basics with a good flash card app. I like <a href="http://brainscape.com/">brainscape</a>, and I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://www.brainscape.com/study?pack_id=1226858">set of flashcards</a> that anyone can download.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2 of <em>Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 2</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Work through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Introduction to JavaScript</a>, sections 1 and 2, on Codecademy.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the Preface and Chapters 3 and 4 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. (According to javascript is sexy: &ldquo;you can skip the section on &lsquo;Bitwise Operators&rsquo;; it is hardly likely you will use those in your JavaScript career.&rdquo;)</p></li>
<li><p>Work through sections 3, 4, and 5 on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 3</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read chapters 5, 6 and 7 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. Note: Only read the “Understanding Objects” section in Chapter 6.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 4</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Finish the JavaScript track on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy</a> (through Objects 1 and Objects 2).</p></li>
<li><p>While you are on Codecademy, go ahead and build the 5 little Basic Projects on the Projects track. After this, you are done with Codecademy. And this is a good thing, because the more you work on your own, the faster you will learn and the better prepared you will be to start programming on your own.</p></li>
<li><p>Read chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. </p></li>
<li><p>Learn jQuery using this free course: http://try.jquery.com/. Work through the entire course. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Mid Terms: Your First Project</h4>

<p><em>Ed note: this is still all taken straight from <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly">javascript is sexy</a>. All I&rsquo;ve done is simplify by making it plain what you should do each week.</em></p>

<p>Before you build your first project, if you plan to be a JavaScript developer or use JavaScript often, you should take a break now and download a trial copy of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>. Learn how to get started with WebStorm <a href="http://2oahu.com/blog/webstorm-javascript/">here</a> (written especially for this course).</p>

<p>Make sure you set WebStorm to use JSHint. JSHint is a “tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions.” The cool thing with using WebStorm is that JSHint automatically adds a red line under errors in your code, just like a spell checker does in a word processing application. So JSHint will show you all the errors in your code (including HTML errors) and make you a better JavaScript programmer, even as you are learning. This is extremely important. You will thank me later after you realize how much WebStorm and JSHint have helped you become a better programmer.</p>

<p>At this juncture, you have learned enough to build a solid web application that is manageable. Don’t proceed any further until you can successfully build this application I describe below. If you are stuck, ask questions on Stack Overflow and reread sections of the book to properly understand the concepts.</p>

<p>You are building a JavaScript quiz application (you will use HTML and CSS as well) that will function as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a simple quiz that has radio button choices, and it will show the user her score upon completion.</li>
<li>The quiz can show any number of questions and any number of choices.</li>
<li>Tally the user’s score and display the final score on the last page. The last page will only show the score, so remove the last question.</li>
<li>Use an array to store all the questions. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer, should be stored in an object. The array of questions should look similar to this:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// Only one question is in this array, but you will add all the questions.</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">allQuestions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nx">question</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">choices</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;David Cameron&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Gordon Brown&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Winston Churchill&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tony Blair&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="nx">correctAnswer</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">}];</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Dynamically (with document.getElementById or jQuery) add the next question and remove the current question from the screen, when the user clicks the “Next” button. The Next button will be the only button to navigate this version of the quiz.</li>
<li>You can ask for help in the comments below or preferably on Stack Overflow. You are likely to get a prompt and accurate answer on Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 5</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read chapters 20 and 23 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers.</li>
<li>At this point, you should be very comfortable with JavaScript, probably feeling like a Jedi. You are not quite a Jedi yet, you must keep using your newly acquired knowledge and skills as often as possible to keep learning and improving.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 6</h4>

<p>Improve Your Quiz Application From Earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.</li>
<li>Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.</li>
<li>Use jQuery to add animation (fade out the current question and fade in the next question).</li>
<li>Test the quiz on IE 8 and 9, and fix any bugs. This will give you a good workout ;)</li>
<li>Store the quiz questions in an external JSON file.</li>
<li>Add user authentication: allow users log in, and save their login credentials to local storage (HTML5 browser storage).</li>
<li>Use cookies to remember the user, and show a “Welcome, First Name” message when the user returns to the quiz.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 7</h4>

<ul>
<li>Read chapter 6 (only the “Object Creation” and “Inheritance” sections this time).</li>
<li>Read chapters 16, 22, and 24. NOTE: The reading in this section of the book is the most technical reading you will encounter in this entire roadmap. It is up to you if you want to read all of it. You should at least learn the Prototype Pattern, Factory Pattern, and Prototypal Inheritance from chapter 6. You don’t have to know all the other patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 8</h4>

<p>Improve Your Quiz Application Even Further:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use Twitter Bootstrap for the entire page layout, including the quiz elements to make it look more professional. As an added bonus, use the tabs user interface component from Twitter Bootstrap and show 4 different quizzes, one on each tab.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/handlebars-js-tutorial-learn-everything-about-handlebars-js-javascript-templating/">Learn Handlebars.js</a> and add Handlebars.js templating to the quiz. You should no longer have any HTML in your JavaScript code. Your quiz is getting more advanced bit by bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a record of all the users who take the quiz and show each user how her score ranks amongst the scores from other quiz takers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Final Exam: A Personal Project</h4>

<p>Decide on a personal project to build, and start building your project promptly (while everything is fresh in your mind). Use the book, <em>Professional JavaScript for Web Developers,</em> as a reference when you are stuck. And of course be an active member of Stack Overflow: ask questions and answer other programmers’ questions.</p>

            <p class="teaser"> There are a lot of options for handling images on a responsive site and none are perfect — hence the need for baby steps. For me, that means using the picturefill.js polyfill combined with a Jekyll/liquid hack. I know there's got to be a better way, but since I'm not sure what that is just yet, I'll do this.</p>
