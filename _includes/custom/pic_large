  This is for large images used in posts and portfolio pages. The large images are not the 
  same as the "hero" images, which appear at the top of the pages. Large images appear in the flow
  of the post.
  The data-picture class is for use with picture-fill polyfill, which selects the best image
  size according to screen size. 
  The sizes (site.AK.med_size and other) are set in config.yml.
