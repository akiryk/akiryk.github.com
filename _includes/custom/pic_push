  This wraps an image with the proper class.
  The actual work of placing the image takes place in: pic_push_pull
  
  To place an image that pulls left, insert the following into your post:
    
  {% assign photo="Name of image" %} 
  {% assign caption="My caption text" %}
  {% include custom/pic_push %}
